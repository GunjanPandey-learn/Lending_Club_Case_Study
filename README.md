## General Information
- To develop our understanding of lending domain we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find out major driving factors.
- Find out the key factors leading to default.
- Lending Club lender's loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Loan amount doesnâ€™t seem to play any significant role in people defaulting.
- The lender has graded the loan in the cat of A-G.
- Higher graded loans are having the high probability of being defaulted.
- Hence, the lender is charging high interest rate on higher graded loans.
